- Functional Requirements:
Requirement analysis is a software engineering approach that consists of a series of activities that establish the
demands or conditions that must be satisfied for a new or updated product while taking into account the potential for competing
requirements from different users.
Functional requirements are those that are used to demonstrate the system's internal functioning nature, as well as the
system's description and explanation of each subsystem. It comprises the task that the system should accomplish, the processes
involved, the data that the system should contain, and the user interfaces.

The functional requirements discovered are as follows:
1. Customer registration – New users should be able to register online and print membership cards.
2. Car reservation online – Customers should be able to utilise the system to book and reserve automobiles online.
3. Automatic database update once a reservation is made or a new customer is registered – The system should be
able to update the database without any further effort from the administrator whenever a new reservation or registration
is made.
- Non-functional Requirements:
It describes system elements that are concerned with how the system fulfils functional requirements. They are as
follows:
1. Security – Only authorised corporate workers may get access to the firm's secured page on the systems, and only users
with proper passwords and usernames can log in to see the users page.
2. Performance and Response Time – The system should have a high-performance rate while executing user input and
should be able to offer feedback or a response in a short amount of time, often 50 seconds for extremely difficult
activities and 20 to 25 seconds for less sophisticated jobs.
3. Error handling – Errors should be avoided as much as possible, and a suitable error message should be supplied to
help the user through the recovery process. The importance of validating user input cannot be overstated. In addition,
the time it takes to recover from a mistake should be between 15 and 20 seconds.
4. Availability – This system must be accessible at all times, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In the event of a
catastrophic system failure, the system should be back up and running within 1 to 2 business days, ensuring that the
business process is not disrupted.
5. Ease of use – Given the consumers' level of understanding, a basic yet high-quality user interface should be created to
make it simple to comprehend and need minimal training.
- Assumptions:
1. At any one moment, each booking is connected with only one automobile reservation.
2. Cars that are part of the system should be available at a certain point.
3. Discount codes may or may not be applied to billing.
4. Due to various cancelled bookings, not all bookings are connected with billing.
5. Since the renter may have his own insurance, the rental insurance may or may not be included in the booking.
